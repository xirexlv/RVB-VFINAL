Privacy-friendly and efficient analytics for your WordPress site

== Description ==

Koko Analytics is a privacy-friendly, simple and lightweight analytics plugin for WordPress. It does not use any external services, so data about your visitors is never shared with any third-party.
No visitor specific data is collected, only aggregated counts.

Stop sharing visitor data with third-party companies who also happen to sell ads.

Stop unnecessarily slowing down your website.

Koko Analytics lets you focus on the important metrics, while respecting the privacy of your visitors.

### Features

- **Plug and play**: After installing and activating the plugin, stats will automatically be collected.
- **No external services**: Any data never leaves your server.
- **No personal data** or anything visitor specific is tracked.
- **No cookies**: There is an option to not use any cookies.
- **Fast**: Handles hundreds of concurrent pageviews without breaking a sweat.
- **Lightweight**: Adds less than 950 bytes of data to your pages. A year worth of data will take up less than 10 MB of storage.
- **GDPR**: Compliant by design.
- **Metrics**: All the essentials: visitors, pageviews, referrers and [flexible custom events](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/kb/tracking-events/).
- **Referrer spam:** Built-in blocklist to filter out referrer spam.
- **Cached**: Fully compatible with pages served from any kind of cache.
- **Open-Source**: The plugin code is open-sourced under the GPL-3.0-or-later license.
- **Tested**: Ready for PHP 8.3, but compatible down to PHP 7.3.
- **AMP**: Tracks AMP powered pages too ([official AMP plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) only).
- **Event Tracking**: You can set up custom event tracking through [Koko Analytics Pro](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/pricing/).

== Installation ==

You can install Koko Analytics in multiple ways:

- In your WordPress admin area, go to **Plugins > New Plugin**, search for **Koko Analytics** and click **Install now**.
- [Download the latest version from WordPress.org](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/koko-analytics.zip) and extract the files into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

After installing and then activating the plugin, statistics will be collected right away.

You can view your analytics dashboard by going to **WP Admin > Dashboard > Analytics**.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Does this respect my visitor's privacy?
Absolutely, nothing that could lead back to the visitor is recorded. If the visitor has "Do Not Track" enabled in their browser settings, the visitor won't be tracked at all.

#### Does this use any external services?
No, the data never leaves your website. That's (part of) what makes Koko Analytics such a great choice if you value true privacy.

### Does this set any cookies?
By default, yes. Koko Analytics sets a single cookie named `_koko_analytics_pages_viewed` with a lifetime of `6 hours`.

This cookie is used to reliably detect unique pageviews and returning visitors without having to store any personal information on your server.

You can disable the use of cookies from the plugin's settings page.

### Will this slow down my website?
No, the plugin is built in such a way that it never slows down your website for your visitors. If there is any heavy lifting to be done, it is done in a background process.

In fact, because the plugin does not depend on any external services it is usually much faster than third-party analytics tools.

### No pageviews are being recorded.
This is usually a file permissions issue. The first thing to check is whether the `/wp-content/uploads/pageviews.php` file exists and is writable by your web server.

### What is the definition of a "pageview"?
A pageview is defined as a view of a page on your site. If a user clicks reload after reaching the page, this is counted as an additional pageview. If a user navigates to a different page and then returns to the original page, a second pageview is recorded as well.

### What is the definition of a "visitor"?
A visitor represents the number of sessions during which your website or a specific page was viewed one or more times.

### How can I help fund Koko Analytics?
You can [purchase Koko Analytics Pro](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/pricing/) to help fund the plugin.
